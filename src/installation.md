# Installation

You can get the latest version of **TTS Helper** [here](https://github.com/Uhuh/tts-helper/releases/latest/).

Download the relevant file for your operating system!

**Some notes**
- I try to build for Windows / Linux / MacOS
  - I only test on Windows. I'm sorry if the other platform experiences suck.
  - Sometimes Linux _doesn't build_ for arbitrary libraries missing.
- Downloading the **.exe** for Windows will almost always be blocked from downloading.
  - This is because I don't pay Windows for a signing key.
  - **Make sure to download the _.msi_ file instead!** It works but may require a "I promise you Windows this isn't a virus".
