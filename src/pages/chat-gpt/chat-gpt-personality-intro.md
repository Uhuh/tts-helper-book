# ChatGPT

The way **TTS Helper** utilizes **OpenAI**'s ChatGPT is that it allows you to "personalize" the model when generating responses from it.

You get to fine tune how ChatGPT generates responses and the length / randomness of said responses.

You also have your basic option of setting a **Character Limit**, just incase you don't want it to ramble on for too long.

> **It may be wise to set a lower Character Limit for ChatGPT if you are using paid services like ElevenLabs, as to avoid eating up your precious credits.**

The **Message History** input has an arbitrary max limit of `20` for now. **OpenAI** doesn't like it when it's given a lot of text.

And if you have a lengthy personality or if a lot of user messages are _long_ then **OpenAI** may fail to generate a response.

**The higher the limit the "more" it cost to generate responses.**  
**Tweak to your liking.**
