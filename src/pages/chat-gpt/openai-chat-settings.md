# ChatGPT Chat Settings

If you came here from [Initial Setup > Chat Settings](../initial-setup/chat-settings.md) hi.

This page is going to tell you to go back there! These chat settings are identical with one difference.

> When you configure the command for **ChatGPT Chat Settings**, anyone that uses it will be sending their message to be **REPLIED** to by your configured OpenAI model.

Besides that difference, you can refer to the other page for the purpose of each input.
