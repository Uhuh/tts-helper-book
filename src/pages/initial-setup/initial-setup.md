# Initial setup and nice to knows.

There are a couple things we need to handle before we start playing some TTS!
- We need to authenticate with Twitch.
- We need to ensure our TTS services are working as expected
  - We'll be using the free ones starting out to learn.

And there are some nice-to-haves before you setup for stream!
- Learn how chat settings work.
- Learn how to configure moderation.
- How to use History / Queue


### Disclaimers
The information you store in **TTS Helper** may be used by third party applications to function properly. 
This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Text content from streaming platforms sent to your selected TTS Service to generate audio.
  - API keys to communicate with third party applications.
  - Audio for Speech to Text services.

**Everything you enter into TTS Helper is saved locally on your computer.**   

**TTS Helper** will not save what you enter to any server. However, when it uses the information you entered to work with third party applications, we (TTS Helper) cannot promise those services won't save the information sent to them.  

Example:
> Communicating with **OpenAI** requires you to provide us with an API token. We use this API token to then communicate with **OpenAI** to generate text responses.

We (TTS Helper) only send the required information to function properly with the supported third party applications.
