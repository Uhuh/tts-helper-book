# Initial setup and nice to knows.

There are a couple things we need to handle before we start playing some TTS!
- We need to authenticate with Twitch.
- We need to ensure our TTS services are working as expected
  - We'll be using the free ones starting out to learn.

And there are some nice-to-haves before you setup for stream!
- Learn how chat settings work.
- Learn how to configure moderation.
- How to use History / Queue


### Disclaimer
Any and all information that you put into **TTS Helper** is **__NEVER__** sent to any servers.  
**Everything is saved locally on your computer.**   
This makes a lot of things simpler (for me), but it does mean if you have multiple devices, sharing settings across them can be annoying.
