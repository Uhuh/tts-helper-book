# ElevenLabs TTS

## Hi! I haven't done this page yet!

Their website [https://elevenlabs.io/](https://elevenlabs.io/)

The process is sorta similar to **OpenAI**'s flow. Getting an API key and all saving it in the **ElevenLabs** tab on the `Text to Speech > Settings` page.

> ElevenLabs DOES give you free monthly credits. They do run out pretty fast though! Be careful.

Besides that, ElevenLabs is a pretty expensive service. I recommend messing with the free credits for a bit and figuring out if it's the right tool for you.
